Overview

The project enhances a dynamic product listing page by applying modern CSS layout techniques (Grid and Flexbox) and interactive visual features. The data is fetched and displayed using products.php, with styling implemented entirely through external CSS—no inline or embedded styles.

Key Features

Responsive Grid Layout: Two-column layout with a search/filter panel on the left and product listings on the right.

Styled Product Cards: Each product displays an image, name, ID, category, price, and action buttons.

Interactive Tooltips: Clicking or focusing on a product name reveals a styled tooltip with stock info and a short description.

Pagination: Supports navigating through product pages with “Previous” and “Next” buttons.

Technologies Used

PHP

CSS (Flexbox & Grid)

MySQL

HTML5

Notes

The CSS is fully custom—no frameworks like Bootstrap were used.

All styling is done via a single, clean external stylesheet.

The tooltip is implemented without JavaScript, relying on pure HTML/CSS interactions.

📁 Folder Structure:

products.php — Displays filtered products with pagination.

style.css — External stylesheet.

view.php — Handles product detail viewing.

clothingStore.sql — SQL dump of the sample product database.
