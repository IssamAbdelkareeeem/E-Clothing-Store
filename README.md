## 📄 Overview

The project enhances a dynamic product listing page by applying modern CSS layout techniques (Grid and Flexbox) and interactive visual features. The data is fetched and displayed using `products.php`, with styling implemented entirely through external CSS — **no inline or embedded styles**.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🟩 **Responsive Grid Layout**  
  Two-column layout with a search/filter panel on the left and product listings on the right.

- 📦 **Styled Product Cards**  
  Each product displays an image, name, ID, category, price, and action buttons.

- 💬 **Interactive Tooltips**  
  Clicking or focusing on a product name reveals a styled tooltip with stock info and a short description.

- 🔁 **Pagination Support**  
  Navigate through product pages using “Previous” and “Next” buttons.
